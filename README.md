# Multi-Threaded Space Invaders Game

Welcome to the Multi-Threaded Space Invaders Game! This project is a Java-based, multi-threaded game
inspired by the classic 2D arcade game Space Invaders. The game follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
design pattern to ensure a clean and modular code structure.

## Description

The Multi-Threaded Space Invaders Game brings the nostalgic gameplay of Space Invaders into the modern era with Java programming. It features multiple threads for concurrent execution, enhancing performance and gameplay experience. The MVC design pattern separates the game's components into three interconnected modules: the Model, which represents the game's data and logic; the View, responsible for rendering the game graphics and user interface; and the Controller, which handles user input and updates the Model accordingly.

## Features

- **Multi-Threading**: Utilizes multiple threads for concurrent execution, enhancing performance and responsiveness.
- **MVC Design Pattern**: Organizes the codebase into Model, View, and Controller modules for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Space Invaders Gameplay**: Enjoy classic Space Invaders gameplay with modern enhancements and optimizations.
- **Customization**: Easily customize game settings, such as difficulty level and graphics, to suit your preferences.
- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for future expansion and addition of new features.

## Game Instructions

This game is based off the popular arcade game Space Invaders.

The goal is to exterminate all the green aliens before they land and the invasion begins.

There are three main boulders at the beginning where the falcon ship can take cover.

Each of these boulders can only take a max of three alien hits before it is destroyed.

When the boulder has been compromised it changes color to alert the player.

You move up levels when there are no more aliens to destroy and the level of difficulty increases as the aliens move down faster.

The blue alien gives you an additional boulder shield that moves with the ship to the next level as long as it isn't destroyed.

The red alien is worth 10 points whereas the green aliens are worth 1 point each.
